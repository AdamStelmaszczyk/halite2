Source code for [mine](https://twitter.com/fakepsyho) bot for [Halite 2](https://halite.io/) programming contest.

You can read my postmortem at [I'm going to put a link here when it's finished]. And it's highly recommended to read it before looking at the source code.

`old.zip` contains (almost) all previous submissions and it's probably the best way to find a quick & easy to write bot that still performs quite well. Please note, it only contains MyBot.cpp file and it's quite probable that changes I made to hlt/* were not backwards compatible.
